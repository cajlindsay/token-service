Hi Guys

I developed this in node 19.4.0 WSL2 so should all work ok there. Should also be
ok on linux and mac. 

The only other things you need to know are:
- 'npm install' to install the dependencies.
- 'npm start' to run the app, with the api listinening at http://localhost:3000
- 'npm test' to run the tests.
